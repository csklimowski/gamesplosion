Closing credits

or end credits
are a list
of the cast and crew
of a particular motion
picture,



television program,

or video game.
Where opening credits
appear at the beginning of
a work, closing credits appear



close to, or at

the very end of a work.
A full set of credits
can include
the cast and



crew,

but also production sponsors,
distribution companies,
works of music licensed or
written for the work,
various legal disclaimers,
such as copyright and more.
Some long-running productions
list "production babies".`;
